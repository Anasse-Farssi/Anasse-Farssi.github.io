							<h1>"20 Olympic Event Questions Answered with SQL Queries from 1896 to 2016"</h1>
							<h3>Introduction:</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 20px;">The objective of this project was to use PostgreSQL to analyze a large dataset containing information about the Olympic Games from 1896 to 2016. The aim was to answer 20 questions related to the Olympics using SQL techniques such as CTEs, temporary tables, subqueries, joins, wildcards, and group by clauses. The dataset was taken from Kaggle and contained a wide range of information about the Olympic Games, including the athletes, countries, sports, and medals won.</p>
							<h3>Methods:</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 20px;">To begin the project, the dataset was imported into PostgreSQL, and the necessary tables were created. Various SQL techniques were then employed to answer the 20 questions related to the Olympics. CTEs and subqueries were used to extract information from the dataset and create new tables, while joins were used to combine multiple tables into a single result set. Wildcards were also used to search for specific information within the dataset.</p>
							<h3>Results:</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 20px;">The 20 questions were successfully answered using a range of SQL techniques. The results included information such as the total number of nations that participated in each Olympic Games, the sport that was played in all summer Olympics, the most successful countries and athletes, and the total number of medals won by each country. </p>
							<h3>Code sample:</h3>
							<p>10.Find the ratio of male and female athletes participated in all Olympic games.</p>
