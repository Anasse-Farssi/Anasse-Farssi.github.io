							<h1>"Collecting and Analyzing S&P 500, Unemployment, and Participation Data"</h1>
							<h3>Introduction:</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 20px;">The objective of this project was to utilize various Python libraries to analyze and visualize economic data. The libraries used include Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Plotly Express, and FREDAPI. The project involved obtaining data from the FRED system, specifically the S&P500 index, and employment and participation rates for each state in the United States. The data was then analyzed and visualized using Python libraries to identify trends and patterns in the data.</p>
							<h3>Methods:</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 20px;">The project began with the creation of a Fred object, which allowed for the searching and retrieval of economic data from the FRED system. The S&P500 index data was obtained and plotted as a line chart with dates on the x-axis and prices on the y-axis. The next step was to retrieve employment and participation rate data for each state in the US. The data was then indexed by state names and cleaned by removing null values. The data for each state was then plotted as an interactive line chart using Plotly Express. 
							<br>Next, the participation rate data was extracted and plotted in the same way. The data was also cleaned and standardized. Finally, a comparison was made between the unemployment and participation rates for each state using subplots. The data was plotted in approximately 50 subplots, with each subplot representing a state.</p>
							<h3>Results:</h3>
							<p style="font-size: 20px;">The Python libraries utilized in this project allowed for the creation of informative and visually appealing economic data visualizations. The S&P500 index was plotted as a line chart showing the trend of prices over time. The employment and participation rates for each state were plotted as interactive line charts, allowing for easy comparison between states. The comparison between the unemployment and participation rates for each state was plotted as subplots, which provided a comprehensive overview of the data.</p>
